TODO
* separate tests to another folder
* add python typing
* add position class (give it a square)
* add tile contracts
* add bools parameters for randomness (include shuffling)
* define equality operator for tests (state of the board before and after, etc.)
* define dragon tile bug exceptions (current player has no tiles, etc.)
* way to construct a game from a failed tester (when a game fails, output the whole game_play (write to a log??))
* function to convert player (position) to square (avoid passing around the square)
* create a square class
* abstraction for the three players
* add the board constants about size and stuff to gameConstants (no more magic numbers)
* whether movePlayers should be a board function or an admin function
* end_game doesn't do anything right now
