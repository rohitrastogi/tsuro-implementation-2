To run tests, type 'make test'
To run tournament, type 'make tournament'

Note:
- We have written libraries for marshalling and unmarshalling, but spent much of this week refactoring (specifically splitting SPlayer and player)
- Due to refactoring, we haven't yet rewritten tests so 'make test' is broken
- 'make tournament' runs however
